/* A way to classify the programming languuage based on their feature is called programming paradigm.
they are of two types  imperative and declarative 
1, imperative programming 
 such type of programming which focuses on how its done not only its desired output is called imperative 
 programming 
  eg : Procedural programming( c and C++ ) and object oriented programming ( c++ and java)
2. Declarative programming 
Such type of programming which focuses on the desired output only not how its done is called declarative 
programming
eg : Sql, html etc
 ***** 
 procedural programming 
  such type of programming language in which the problems are decomposed  into smaller unit
  of repeatable tasks (procedures) is called procedural programming language 
Disadvantages of procedural programming 
1. focuses on process
2. no information hiding 
3. Difficult to manage large problems 
4. Difficult to relate with  real world objects 
  object oriented programming 
   such type of programming language which relies onn thhe concept of object and class are called object oriented
   programming 
    a class is thus a similar number of objects 
    a instance of class is called object 

Procedural programming vs object oriented programming language
procedural programming                              |               object oriented programming 
--Focuses on operation                              |    -- focuses on object
-- focuses top - down approach                      |    -- focuses buttom - up approach

principles of object oriented programming 
1. encapsulation
2. inheritance
3. polymorphism
4. abstraction

1. encapsulation 
 Data encapsulation and data hiding are the major concepts of object oriented programmming 
encapsulation refers to the bundling of the data and method that operate on that data within a single unit or
object this can help data to be ascessed , modified from outside the code or project
2. abstraction 
abstraction is the process of exposing only the relevant data and methods to the user while hiding the implementation
detaails . This can help to simplify the interface and make the code easier to understand
3. inheritance 
inheritance is the process by which one object can inhherit the properties and behaviour of another object 
this can help to eliminate the redundancy in code and make it  easier to  reuse existing code 
4 . polymorphism : Polymorphism is the ability of  different objects to respond to the same method calls in different
ways. this can allow for  more flexibilityy in the design of your code .
 Benefits of object  oriented programming 
  1. reusability
  2. Robustness
  3. extensibility 
  4. Easier to manage
